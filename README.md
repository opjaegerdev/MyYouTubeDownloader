Lightweight & Portable YouTube video downloader https://github.com/opjaegerdev/MyYoutubeDownloader

Requires FFMpeg in this app's directory (next to the .exe) or in your systems $PATH https://www.ffmpeg.org/

I didnt tread any new ground here I just wanted to do it myself. Right now there is very basic functionality. 
It will download at the highest available quality.
